🎶 Songlyrics

This is a repository dedicated to storing and managing song lyrics, likely with a focus on displaying them synchronized to the corresponding music.

📝 Project Overview

This repository houses the code and data necessary to generate and display song lyrics. The Python files, like the one currently present, are intended to store or process the lyrics for specific songs.

🎤 Features

- Synchronized Lyrics Display: (If this is the project's goal, emphasize it here) The ultimate goal is to process the lyrics so they can be displayed in sync with the song's audio playback.
- Easy Song Addition: Simple structure for adding new songs (e.g., creating a new Python file for each song's lyrics/timing data).

🛠️ How It Works 

This repository serves as the centralized data source for all synchronized song lyrics. The workflow focuses on accurately creating and maintaining the data files that will be consumed by your external lyric display application.
